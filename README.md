# Day 1

## Part 1
I have no clue how the first part passed as I noticed after I submitted it that there was a bug in the dial reset as it most of the time didn't reset it correctly due to a missing 1. Should have been 100 * 1 + rotationCorrection but was actual 100 * rotationCorrection so it was 0 most of the time. But after adding that I now don't solve part one so I guess it was right somehow? I really don't understand math 😖.

### Part 2
So after a day at work and some food I realized that math is not for me so I bruteforced this one. I also spent some time cleaning up some logic like the wraping of the numbers. I think if I had just used brute force from the start on one I could have done both during my lunch break but c'est la vie.


# Day 2

## Part 1
I was a bit tierd when I started it but went smooth the only thing is that since the numbers got so large my prepared class that returns an int could not return the correct value as it needed to be a long and you can't cast it right. Reworked it to return a string just to avoid this issue in the futuer.

## Part 2
I took a dinner break and with the energy of food I rememberd that Regex is a thing. I probebly could have done a better work parsing the input but I got the awnsers one both first trys so I am happy.

# Day 3

## Part 1
I did not have a lot of time today but I was lucky that it was a simpel task today.

## Part 2
I hade a bit of troubel with how c# handeld the input so I got the wrong awnser at first.

# Day 4

## Part 1
Today was also quite easy I do like algorithem based onese inted to math onese

## Part 2
I am trying to bet better so I wanted to try itterators.

# Day 5

## Part 1
I guess I have gotten a lot better since I last tried Advent of Code. It can probebly be more optemized but I have noticed that part 2 is the harder part so since I don't have to much time I just brute force pat 1 to get more time for part 2.

## part 2
I miss read the asignment at first so had this really neat method to find the higes and lowest in all the ranges but when the test part didn't match I re read it and saw my mistake. Linq dose most of the heavey lifting in this one then it's just some cleanup.

# Day 6

## Part 1
When I first saw the input I just thought fuck. But The first part turned out to be really simpel.

## Part 2
Why the fuck did they have to have such a complex way of doing math. Well I got a lot better at parsing but only the gods know how tf ParseCephalopodWorksheet Works I still don't know exactly how I got it to work but when I had that down the rest was quite easy. I would like to be better at parsing but I also thing that c# was working a bit against me on this one. I ended up using a temporary character X to preserve the spacec so the final numbers would not be compleatly fucked. 

# Day 7

## Part 1
I had a bit of a hard time understanding the task at first I tried to do it manualy to see how it worked but I never got 21. But after re-reading it a coupel of times it clicked. There is probebly some mathematical way to solve it rahter then simulate the walking but you know I like to brute force things rather then doing math.

## Part 2
So I got to read up a bit on many-worlds interpretation something I did not know before or well maybe but not by name. I was reading a bunch and it all seamd like a bunch of math but in the end it's just counting so you can simulate it. And yes I should probebl learn how to do this elegantly with math formulas and all that jazz but after yesterdays Cephalopd insident I am a bit angy at math.
