# Day 1

## Part 1
I have no clue how the first part passed as I noticed after I submitted it that there was a bug in the dial reset as it most of the time didn't reset it correctly due to a missing 1. Should have been 100 * 1 + rotationCorrection but was actual 100 * rotationCorrection so it was 0 most of the time. But after adding that I now don't solve part one so I guess it was right somehow? I really don't understand math 😖.

### Part 2
So after a day at work and some food I realized that math is not for me so I bruteforced this one. I also spent some time cleaning up some logic like the wraping of the numbers. I think if I had just used brute force from the start on one I could have done both during my lunch break but c'est la vie.


# Day 2

## Part 1
I was a bit tierd when I started it but went smooth the only thing is that since the numbers got so large my prepared class that returns an int could not return the correct value as it needed to be a long and you can't cast it right. Reworked it to return a string just to avoid this issue in the futuer.

## Part 2
I took a dinner break and with the energy of food I rememberd that Regex is a thing. I probebly could have done a better work parsing the input but I got the awnsers one both first trys so I am happy.

# Day 3

## Part 1
I did not have a lot of time today but I was lucky that it was a simpel task today.

## Part 2
I hade a bit of troubel with how c# handeld the input so I got the wrong awnser at first.

# Day 4

## Part 1
Today was also quite easy I do like algorithem based onese inted to math onese

## Part 2
I am trying to bet better so I wanted to try itterators.

# Day 5

## Part 1
I guess I have gotten a lot better since I last tried Advent of Code. It can probebly be more optemized but I have noticed that part 2 is the harder part so since I don't have to much time I just brute force pat 1 to get more time for part 2.

## part 2
I miss read the asignment at first so had this really neat method to find the higes and lowest in all the ranges but when the test part didn't match I re read it and saw my mistake. Linq dose most of the heavey lifting in this one then it's just some cleanup.
